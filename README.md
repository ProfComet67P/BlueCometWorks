Hello Everyone,

My Name is Justin Jacob McCollum and I am the Laboratory Coordinator for the Physics Dept at Lamar University in Beaumont, SE Texas along with being an instructor in Astronomy & Space Sciences. I am a recent graduate of Woz U through the Southern Careers Institute.

My Final Project after completing a 35 week program:

Earth - Like Exoplanet Habitability

The original title: 

The Analysis of Potentially Habitable Earth â€“ Like Exoplanets orbiting Red Dwarf Stars versus other classifications of stars.

Abstract: 

The scope of this project was the analysis of data collected on exoplanets from a variety of NASA/ESA space mission, research and survey projects using observatories (such as TRAPPIST using ESO La Silla Observatory, et. al). Thousands of planetary candidates and confirmed discoveries have been collected in dataframes onto European and NASA websites devoted to studying and search for patterns with exoplanets available for both professional, educational, and citizen science research. The original dataframe acquired from December 2019 contained about 4104 confirmed exoplanets. Our chosen dataframe contained over 110 variables of which only a handful where selected for defining the correct variables with the limited parameters matching closely to our planet Earth. A narrow selection of IVs (independent variables), DVs (dependent variables), and a CV (control variable) within a narrow set of parameters was required to search for exoplanets that have potential habitability with Earth - like properites. Professional Astronomers and Astrophysicists have known or theorize that a majority of the stars in our home galaxy (the Milky Way) and potentially the Universe are likely red dwarf stars (smaller and dimmer than our Sun, but with immensely longer lifespans). Red dwarfs stars are estimated to make up at least 70% of all the 200 - 400 billion stars that make up the Milky Way Galaxy and it would seem logical to conclude that most of the planets in our galaxy potentially habitable, Earth - like exoplanets would orbit these types of stars.

It was decided within the conditions of our project to fit within our goals to search for and compare the distribution and frequency of potentially habitable, exoplanets with Earth - like characteristics existing and orbiting red dwarf stars and compare the data with equivalent planetary bodies orbiting other types of stars. The classification system of stars depending on the Havard Classification System which depends on a set of variables: Lifespan, Effective Surface Temp, Mass, Absolute Magnitude, and Radii. These many parameters allows for a OBAFGKM system for which O class stars are the Hot, Bluish giant stars to the M class cool, red dwarf stars. Our project being apart of a group known as the Exoplanet Explorers composed of two members; myself (Beaumont, TX) and software engineer Mr. Allen Bencomo from California. Our conclusions determine a higher percentage of potentially habitable, Earth - Like planets revolving around red dwarf stars with a 67% precision based on the application of 'Random Forest' and 'Decision Tree' analysis using Python. The results of which there as a strong correlation of habitable planets within the specified parameters of greater frequency based on the limited availability of data known as of December 2019 existing in orbit around Red Dwarf Stars. The potential to find potentially habitable planets and the search of Extraterrestrial Life microbial to the complex is statistically more probable in planetary systems orbiting red dwarf stars than all other classifications of stars based on the available evidence. All of our parameters with the exception of the analysis including the semi - major axis (average orbital distance) of exoplanets around stars had Pr(>F) > or >> 0.05 showing no significance indicating a strong correlation for searching habitable exoplanets based on knowledge our own Solar System. This search was limited based on the availability of data and the current scientific knowledge known about planetary systems. Assumptions were maded based on using the only known planetary model for the evolution and development of Carbon - based life; the planet Earth. All exoplanet candidates needed to be either Terrestrial (rocky) and Super - Terrestrial (larger than the Planet Earth).

Data Available and Files for Results/Analysis:

1) Data Science Group Proposal - Earth Like Exoplanet Habitability
2) Suggested Parameters for Potential Earth - Like Habitability
3) Original Exoplanet Dataframe (Excel format: csv changed to xlsx for more efficient coding and data analysis).
4) RStudio Data Science File: Code and Results (Code includes converting RStudio datasets to excel format: xlsx and some basic 3D plotting of multiple variables with the defined parameter ranges.)

This group presentation was presented to on online attendance at Woz U enpowered through the Southern Careers Institute. I would like to thank my fellow project member: Allen Bencomo who worked on the Python code with assistance from myself in guidence with the appropriate dataframe, selection of variables, parameter ranges, and determing the statistical testing and methods. I would also like to thank Dr. Meredith Dodd who was my project mentor and advisor during my training and certification in Data Science throughout my 35 weeks at Woz U. A personal Thank You to Mr. Devin Moya who has been a personal mentor and my course mentor without my education and training to become a research - oriented Data Scientist.

This project was presented online (Zoom): 7 February 2020
